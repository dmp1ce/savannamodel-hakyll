# Quotes

Brussels Sprouts are a *low-glycemic, rich in micronutrients and fiber, and harmless with regard to anti-nutrients and antigens.* ~[Paleo in a Nutshell](/about.html) p.70

*Eat at least 2 3/4 lbs of mixed salad and vegetables per day, consisting of "Green-Green” and “Green” foods. Of these, at least 3/4 lb should be mixed salad. Also include at least 5 cups of “Green-Green” leafy vegetables or 2 1/2 cups of other vegetables per week.* ~[Paleo in a Nutshell](/about.html) p.102

*modern species of intensively cultivated plants tend to have lower protein content, but there are exceptions: Brussels sprouts contain 24% protein per 100 grams dry-weight.* ~[Deadly Harvest](/about.html) p.125

*Can humans get enough protein from plant foods alone? We need less protein than we think— about 75 grams per day for an average 165-pound adult. That equates to about 2 pounds (1 kg) of Brussels sprouts per day. Not impossible!* ~[Deadly Harvest](/about.html) p.125
