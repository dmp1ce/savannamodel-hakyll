# Guideline

Broccoli is a *Green-Green* food and safe to eat as a regular part of your diet.

# Quotes

*Salt, until very recent times, was a scarce commodity. In our ancestral homeland, it was unknown. Humans and other creatures only absorbed sodium from what was innate to the food they were eating. For example, uncooked broccoli contains, quite naturally, 27 mg of sodium per 100 g. Similarly, it contains 325 mg of potassium per 100 g. This ratio (about 1 to 12) of sodium to potassium is of fundamental importance for our body cells to function properly.*  ~[Paleo in a Nutshell](/about.html) p.55

*Since we are recommending that you consume an abundance of conforming non-starchy,  colored  plant foods, what plant foods are  "conforming"? They are foods that are low-glycemic, rich in micronutrients and fiber, and harmless with regard  to  anti-nutrients  and  antigens.  Broadly,  they  include  most  salad  foods, such  as  lettuce,  onions,  cucumber,  radish,  and  mushrooms,  and  they  also include  colored  vegetables,  such  as  broccoli,  green  beans,  bell  peppers  (sweet peppers),  and  Brussels  sprouts.* ~[Paleo in a Nutshell](/about.html) p.62

*Through  the  afternoon, you  may begin to  feel  hungry.  Keep  ready prepared  in your  fridge  some  raw  broccoli,  cauliflower,  and  baby  carrots,  and  also  have some containers of preservative-free dips, such as guacamole.* ~[Paleo in a Nutshell](/about.html) p.89

*Dinner  involves  the  same  decision-making  process  as  at lunch  time.  This  time you decide to do some cooking. Maybe 12 oz per person of stir-fried vegetables accompanied by two eggs,  any style.  Or a  grilled  trout with a  head of steamed broccoli.  It's as easy as that.* ~[Paleo in a Nutshell](/about.html) p.89

At a restaurant, *If green  beans,  broccoli,  spinach,  or  any  other green vegetable is available, ask for double portions.* ~[Paleo in a Nutshell](/about.html) p.90

*With regard to plant food, it is always best to eat it as soon as possible after harvesting and to eat it raw. That is why we put the emphasis on the consumption  of  salads  and  for  them  to  be  as  fresh  as  possible.  Be  imaginative—many vegetables  can  form  part  of  a  mixed  salad,  including  chopped  broccoli,  cauliflower, cabbage, zucchini, and leeks.* ~[Paleo in a Nutshell](/about.html) p.91

*The best method for cooking vegetables is steaming or blanching. For example, you can cook broccoli florets in boiling water for three minutes, which will minimize  nutrient loss.  Microwave steaming is  acceptable,  although  it is  more aggressive  on  nutrient  loss.* ~[Paleo in a Nutshell](/about.html) p.91

*The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) does not subdivide its Vegetable Group: they classify french fries and ketchup as vegetables just like lettuce and broccoli. As this example shows, it does indeed make a difference just what kind of vegetable we are eating— not all "vegetables" conform to the type of plant food to which we are naturally adapted.* ~[Deadly Harvest](/about.html) p.54

*In common parlance, starches are still called complex carbohydrates; however, a new category of "very complex carbohydrates" has been created for foods such as broccoli, lettuce, and so on, and these now inherit the mantle of "good" carbohydrates.* ~[Deadly Harvest](/about.html) p.98

*Abnormal testosterone production is a major risk factor for prostate cancer. Some compounds, such as lignans, lock up testosterone and stop it from creating damage. Lignans are a kind of plant fiber. The highest concentrations of lignans are found in flaxseed, followed by squash, broccoli, carrots, and asparagus.* ~[Deadly Harvest](/about.html) p.236
