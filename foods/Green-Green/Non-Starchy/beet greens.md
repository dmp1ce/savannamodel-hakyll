Beet greens is a *Green-Green* food and safe to eat as a regular part of your diet.

*Eat at least 2 3/4 lbs of mixed salad and vegetables per day, consisting of "Green-Green” and “Green” foods. Of these, at least 3/4 lb should be mixed salad. Also include at least 5 cups of “Green-Green” leafy vegetables or 2 1/2 cups of other vegetables per week.* ~[Paleo in a Nutshell](/about.html) p.102
