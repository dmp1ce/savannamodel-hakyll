<i>Since we are recommending that you consume an abundance of conforming non-starchy,  colored  plant foods, what plant foods are  "conforming"? They are foods that are low-glycemic, rich in micronutrients and fiber, and harmless with regard  to  anti-nutrients  and  antigens.  Broadly,  they  include  most  salad  foods, such  as  lettuce,  onions,  cucumber,  radish,  and  mushrooms,  and  they  also include  colored  vegetables,  such  as  broccoli,  green  beans,  bell  peppers  (sweet peppers),  and  Brussels  sprouts.</i>
