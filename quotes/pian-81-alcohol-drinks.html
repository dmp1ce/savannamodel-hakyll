<i>Some alcohol drinks can be tolerated, but do not go out of your way to start consuming them if they are not already part of your diet. Beer is highly glycemic and potentially allergenic. Dry wine is acceptable and red wine is mildly healthful when consumed in moderation. One might be surprised at the moderate classification of spirits like gin and whiskey. Most spirits are all right, especially if diluted in a suitable, low-sugar mixer (for example, whiskey and soda; gin and diet tonic). Bear in mind that alcohol is empty calories and it disrupts your body's ability to burn fat, so you will struggle to lose weight if you consume alcohol.</i>
