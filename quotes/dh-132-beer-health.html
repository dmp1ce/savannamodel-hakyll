<i>Beer is brewed using the sugars from malted barley, so there is a percentage of the highly glycemic sugar, maltose. There is usually about 4 grams per 100 ml, which translates to about 3 teaspoons of sugar per 12 ounce can. Beer is in itself a "bad" carbohydrate with a high glycemic index. That is why big beer drinkers tend to suffer from the various sugar diseases— and put on a beer belly— when wine drinkers do not.</i>
