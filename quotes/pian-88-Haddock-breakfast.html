<i>Old-Fashioned Haddock Breakfast. This used to be a good standby in many parts of the English-speaking world. Many people are old enough to remember, perhaps, when their grandparents used to eat like this. They would lightly poach a piece of haddock (or kipper or any other appropriate fish) in simmering water for about five minutes. They would accompany it with lashings of sauteed onion, grilled tomatoes, and mushrooms.</i>
