<i>Many studies have shown that saturated fats, particularly hydrogenated and trans-fats, are powerful immune depressors, allowing cancers to flourish. Finally, the traditional consumption of oily fish provides them with the "good" omega-3 oils. We are unwittingly depressing our immune system with a diet overloaded with omega-6 oils. Drive these out of your diet and favor the omega-3 oils at every opportunity. But don't go too far. The ideal is a 1-to-l balance, but you don't have to micromanage itâ€”just follow the Savanna Model and the ratio works out just fine.</i>
