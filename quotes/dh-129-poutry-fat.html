<i>The fat from goose and duck is semi-liquid at room temperature, which tells us that there is not much saturated fat in it. The fat of these birds has a high percentage of monounsaturated fat. This seems to be one more element helping to explain the French Paradoxâ€” the people of Toulouse use these fats in preference to butter, thus increasing their intake of monounsaturated fats.</i>
