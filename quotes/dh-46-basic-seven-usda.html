With the creation of the "basic seven", several changes were made from the 12 food groups in the family food plans. <i>"Potatoes and sweet potatoes" have been lumped in with "other vegetables and fruit." "Eggs" and "dry beans, peas, and nuts" are lumped in with "meat, poultry, and fish." The "butter" group has been expanded to "butter and fortified margarine." The word lean has been dropped from the category "lean meat." The "other fats" group and the "sugars" group have disappeared entirely.</i>
