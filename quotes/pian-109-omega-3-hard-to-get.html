<i>If you are eating according to th e Savanna Model, what is the likelihood that you are suffering any deficiencies? The answer is, highly unlikely. You will be consuming eight times the weight of non-starchy plant food compared to the average Am erican. So, even on plant foods with "reduced levels" of micronutrients in th e soil in w hich they're grow n, your intake will be w ell into the healthy intake comfort zone. The one nutrient that is hard to get this way is omega-3 essential fa tty acids. In this regard, we strongly recommend eating at least one portion of oily fish per day instead of popping an omega-3 supplement.</i>
