<i>Salt, until very recent times, was a scarce commodity. In our ancestral homeland, it was unknown. Humans and other creatures only absorbed sodium from what was innate to the food they were eating. For example, uncooked broccoli contains, quite naturally, 27 mg of sodium per 100 g. Similarly, it contains 325 mg of potassium per 100 g. This ratio (about 1 to 12) of sodium to potassium is of fundamental importance for our body cells to function properly.</i>
