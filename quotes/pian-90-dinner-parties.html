<i>In some ways, a dinner party is the hardest situation to manage. You don't want to put your hosts under pressure, and you want to be invited another day. If you know your hosts well, it is all right to call in advance and mention that you have special dietary requirements. Say that you prefer fish over red meat or that you don't like to eat fruit after a meal. Mention that you like green salads and lots of green vegetables. Then, dig into your meal and enjoy it for what it is. You will certainly have to compromise, but if your basic eating habits are natural and healthy, the occasional lapse is not going to be the end of the world.</i>
