Creatures such <i>as alligator, ostrich, emu, kangaroo, frogs' legs, and escargots (snails). All correspond very well to the kind of animal matter that our Pleistocene ancestors ate all the time. Other exotic foods are making their appearance, particularly bush tucker from Australia, which corresponds to the food traditionally eaten by the Australian Aboriginal.</i>
