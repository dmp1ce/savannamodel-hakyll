<i>These early farmers, about 8000 B.C., found three creatures that lent themselves to taming and breeding in captivity: the "mouflon," the "pasang," and the wild boar. In 6000 B.C., this same ingenious people domesticated the massive aurochs, an ox-like creature that stood six feet high at the shoulder. All four species of animal had body compositions very similar to the wild game eaten by our ancestors of the Savanna Model.</i>
