<i>Fruits in our ancestral homeland were much less sugary and less watery than most of the fruits we have today. Flowever, most berries (raspberries, blueberries, redcurrants, strawberries, etc.) are low-glycemic; grapefruit, apples, bananas, and many other fruits are also okay. But we have to go easy on sweet, sugary fruits like pineapple, mango, and melons.</i>
