<i>Ever inventive, these New Stone Age farmers bred these animals to improve their value and usefulness. However, in doing so over the past 10,000 years they, and all farmers since, changed the breed. The mouflon has been transformed into the sheep, the wild boar's descendant is the pig, the aurochs became the smaller cow, and the pasang became today's goat. As we shall see, with the exception of the goat, the changes were not beneficial.</i>
