<i>All these omega-3 oils should only be used cold—in a salad dressing, for example. Omega-3 oils do not resist heat very well and the oil oxidizes and becomes toxic. If you need to heat the oil for cooking, then a monounsaturated (and thus inert) oil is best. Canola oil can fit the bill since its omega-3 content will withstand modest temperatures up to 340°F. We advise that cooking should never exceed this temperature anyway, but if it does, then olive oil is safest to use.</i>
