<i>Glycemic  index  scores  present  a  few  surprises.  Starchy  foods  like  bread (even whole-wheat) and breakfast cereal  (corn flakes) are  "bad"  carbohydrates. Fruits  are  all  over  the  place:  pineapple  is  "bad,"  banana  is  "borderline,"  and raspberries are  "favorable."  Unsurprisingly, non-starchy, non-sugary foods like most nuts, salads, and vegetables fit into the "favorable" category</i>
