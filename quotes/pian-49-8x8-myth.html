<i>Where did the 8x8 myth (the idea that we must drink at least eight 8-ounce cups of water a day) come from? Nobody knows! The nearest clue we have is that back in the 1940s, the Food and Nutrition Board opined that daily fluid intake should be around 64 fluid ounces (8 x 8-ounce cups). But this recommendation came with the proviso that most of the fluids would com e from food. Then, with the magic of modern marketing in the 1980s, we were persuaded to buy water from a bottle and glug from it at every opportunity. Many of the arguments are manipulative and utterly spurious: For example, that drinking all this water helps to lose weight, or that it "detoxifies the body."</i>
