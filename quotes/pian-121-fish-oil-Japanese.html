<i>Traditionally, the Japanese are Buddhists and, as such, they did not eat animals at all. However, they did eat fish, often raw. By Western standards, it was a high consumption, around 90 g (3.15 oz) per person per day (four times as much as the average American). From this, they got a high consumption of omega-3 fish oil, notably the essential fatty acid eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA).</i>
