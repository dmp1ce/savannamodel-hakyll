<i>The Cretans ate frugally; they ate fish but virtually no meat (just the occasional goat's meat, as beef was nonexistent); they ate plenty of plant food, notably a salad-green called purslane; and they consumed very little dairy, pastries, or sugars. Unlike the Okinawans, they ate bread— a rough-ground, whole-wheat variety— and they had a moderate fat consumption through the sparing use of olive oil in the kitchen. They also had an extraordinary custom: For the Cretan, traditional breakfast often consisted of a small amount of olive oil downed in one gulp, and that was it until lunch time. Wine was also commonly drunk, but in moderation.</i>
