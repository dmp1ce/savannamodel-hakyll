<i>This category includes such creatures as alligator, ostrich, emu, kangaroo, frogs' legs, and escargots (snails). The last two have a long, honorable tradition in France and they all correspond very well to the kind of animal matter that our Pleistocene ancestors ate all the time. Other exotic foods are making their appearance, particularly bush tucker from Australia, which corresponds to the food traditionally eaten by the Australian Aboriginal. My wife and I have sat down with aborigines in Central Australia to eat one of their delicacies, witchety grub. Lightly roasted in the embers of a fire, the 3-inch-long caterpillar tastes rather like sweet corn.</i>
