<i>Oats, of all the grains, contain rather more soluble fiber than average, a quality that manufacturers promote as cholesterol-reducing and therefore hearthealthy. This, nevertheless, is not a valid argument: They are still glycemic, contain anti-nutrients and antigens, and are deficient in micronutrients. Oats are no alternative to proper plant food, like lettuce and avocado.</i>
