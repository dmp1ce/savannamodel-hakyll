<i>For a snack before bedtime, if there has been a sufficient gap after the last meal, eat a low-glycemic fruit (as much as you like). If not, try 1 oz of nuts. Avoid bad carbohydrates this late in the dayâ€” they provoke a hormonal reaction that disturbs sleep and interferes with the body's nighttime repair processes. If you fancy it, have a mug of cocoa or about .75 oz of dark chocolate (made up of at least 75 percent cocoa solids).</i>
