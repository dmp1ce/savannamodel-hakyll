<i>Cocoa powder is low-glycemic. Chocolate that is made with a high percentage of cocoa solids (and therefore little sugar) is low-glycemic. Generally, if "cocoa solids" comes before sugar on the ingredients list, it is probably acceptable to eat. In the raw, natural state, cocoa is rich in the micronutrients known as flavanols. These flavonols are much vaunted for benefits such as reducing Alzheimer's risk, LDL oxidation, and inflammation.</i>
