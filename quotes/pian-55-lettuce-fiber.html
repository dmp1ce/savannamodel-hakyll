<i>Our evolutionary past designed our digestive systems to have high volumes of plant food passing through them. These non-starchy plant foods were, by nature, low-density: That is, they had few calories for their volume. A lettuce leaf, for example, is 95 percent water (the remaining 5 percent is a wonderful cornucopia of vital nutrients). In addition, plant food is rich in various plant fibers, the sort that our colons are designed to work with. The typical Western diet is the opposite: Energy-dense and low in fiber.</i>
