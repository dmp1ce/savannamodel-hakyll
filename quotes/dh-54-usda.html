<i>The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) does not subdivide its Vegetable Group: they classify french fries and ketchup as vegetables just like lettuce and broccoli. As this example shows, it does indeed make a difference just what kind of vegetable we are eatingâ€” not all "vegetables" conform to the type of plant food to which we are naturally adapted.</i>
