For the Japanese, <i>The largest percentage of their fat came from rapeseed (canola) oil. East Asians have cultivated rapeseed for millennia, and the Japanese have used rapeseed oil in frugal amounts for at least 2,000 years. To a lesser extent, they used soybean oil. Consumption of saturated fats, hydrogenated fats, and trans fatty acids was almost zero.</i>
