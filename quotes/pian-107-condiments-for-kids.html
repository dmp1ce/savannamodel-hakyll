<i>What about condiments? It's been said that the only way to get a kid to eat his vegetables is to smother them in ketchup. If that is what works, then it is tolerable; a good quality ketchup is not such a bad condiment. The main drawback is the sugar content. Read the ingredients label and only choose the bestâ€” there are low-salt, low-sugar versions available. Better yet is to make it yourself.</i>
