<i>Reptile foods, including crocodile, alligator, and turtle, although uncommon in the Western diet, are still readily available to the enthusiast. In addition, many societies make use of snakes, such as python and boa constrictor, and the French have made a delicacy of frog's legs. All of these foods, as they are currently available, readily fit the Savanna Model.</i>
