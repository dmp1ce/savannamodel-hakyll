<i>Many  fruits,  often  of  tropical  origin,  are  high glycemic.  They are  not pariahs, but we should not go  out of our way to obtain them.  If you find  a morsel or two in your fruit salad,  swallow it down, it won't poison  you.  But  do  not  consume  these  regularly  or  copiously.  Examples  are watermelon, pineapple,  and ripe banana.</i>
