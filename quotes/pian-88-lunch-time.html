<i>A suitable choice for lunch is a mixed salad, and an appropriate quantity might be 12 oz. Weigh foods until you are used to estimating the quantities by eyeâ€” it's larger than you are used to. Get in the habit of thinking that a salad is often in two parts: The salad vegetables, comprised uniquely of foods from Food Group 3 (Non-starchy Vegetables), and some additions of protein-rich foods from Food Group 6 (Meat, Poultry, Eggs, and Fish). You can add tuna or chicken breast, for example, to the salad or eat as a side dish. Use a simple homemade vinaigrette of mustard, olive oil, lemon juice, and vinegar.</i>
