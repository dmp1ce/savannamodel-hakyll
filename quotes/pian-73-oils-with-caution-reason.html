<i>In nature, fats and oils do not occur on their own: They are always part of something else. The Bushman could not eat the mongongo oil without eating the nut; he could not eat the animal fat without eating the animal. Fats and oils in their separated state are in a very concentrated form and therefore more potent. That is why they should always be treated with caution.</i>
