<i>The average cup of American coffee contains 100 mg caffeine, whereas coffeehouse strength can be 180 mg per cup. The caffeine content of tea varies, but it averages about 40-50 mg per cup. There are also about 40 mg of caffeine in a 12-ounce can of cola. In a cocoa drink (2 teaspoons of pure cocoa powder), there are only 10 mg caffeine. Our view is that caffeine in modest amounts is well within the normal range for human consumption. (See "What Is 'Modest' Caffeine Consumption?" below.) For a 165- pound adult, that works out to four cups of American coffee per day or eight cups of tea. Be sensible about it, watch how your caffeine intake affects your mood, and avoid overdosing. If you are diabetic, caffeine in the form of moderate tea or coffee drinking might even be helpful.</i>
