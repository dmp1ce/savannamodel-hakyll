<i>Certain saturated fats derived from plants, like coconut oil and cocoa butter, have become a fetish consumption by some health mavens. Actually, none of these fats was common in our savanna environment but, by a quirk of triglyceride biochemistry, their palmitic and myristic acids (the harmful fatty acids found in saturated fats) are not readily bioavailable. This means they are not readily taken in by the body. As a result, they do not have the devastating effect on our biochemistry that those fats of animal origin do.</i>
