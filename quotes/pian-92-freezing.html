<i>"Fresh is best" is a familiar slogan and it is good for us, too. However, that is not always possible, so how do we prioritize? Broadly speaking, the "least bad" alternative to fresh plant food is frozen. Frozen plant foods, such as cauliflower, spinach, and chopped onion, have been quickly prepared in the field, and then blanched and frozen nearby. Blanching is designed to destroy certain enzymes that cause discoloration, softening, and bruising. It is likely that these are background micronutrients that are useful to the human body and become lost in the blanching process. So, here we make a compromise: In the absence of an alternative, freezing is the least of all evils.</i>
