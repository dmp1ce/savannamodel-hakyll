<i>Consumption of omega-6 vegetable oils rocketed from 12 lbs per head per year in 1965 to 50 lbs per head per year today— that's a 400 percent increase! In parallel, consumption of fish declined and food manufacturers stripped omega-3 oil out of their products— why? Because it goes rancid easily and so has a short shelf life, equaling a lower monetary profit for food manufacturers.</i>
