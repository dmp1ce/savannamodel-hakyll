<i>The slogan "drink eight glasses a day" is a highly misleading piece of marketing by the mineral and bottled water companies. Other water manufacturers jumped on the bandwagon with so-called special property waters— mineralized, ionized, magnetized, polarized— a whole range of sales gimmicks to gull the public. We now live, quite falsely, in terror of not drinking enough water. Just know that if you follow the Savanna Model to the full, you will be getting four pints (64 oz) of water just from what you eat. The bottom line is that we need only drink when thirsty. By all means, drink bottled water, but water out of the tap is probably just as good.</i>
