<i>Milk is simply not human food and is harmful to our biochemistry. The milk of almonds (and other nuts) is a great alternative to regular milk, particularly in cookery. However, soy milk must be avoided. Fruit juices, even when freshly made, are glycemicâ€” for this reason, they get the "Amber" classification. It is much better to eat the fruit itself. Watch out for tomato juice: Choose brands that are made from pure tomatoes and have no salt. Sugar-sweetened carbonated drinks and colas are high-glycemic and disrupt bone building.</i>
