<i>cocoa powder is low glycemic. Moreover it is a "Green" plant food, rich in a wide range of antioxidants and other micronutrients. If cocoa is combined with "safe" ingredients, it can make an excellent chocolate. The dark, bitter chocolate made with a minimum of 75% cocoa solids is low glycemic. Read the fine printâ€” if "cocoa solids" come before sugar on the list, then this is probably acceptable. Really good varieties will have the exact percentage of cocoa indicated. You can eat this kind of chocolate safely at the end of a meal, but discipline yourself to eat just a couple of squares (about 1 ounce). Some enterprising makers of diabetic chocolate (sweetened with "Green-Amber" sugar alcohols) have rebranded their chocolate as a "low -carb" or "diet" chocolate; these are fine in moderation.</i>
