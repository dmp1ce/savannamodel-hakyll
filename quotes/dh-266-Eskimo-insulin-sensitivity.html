<i>Studies on Eskimos demonstrate that a high consumption of omega-3 fatty acids (in their case, mainly from fish oils) improve insulin sensitivity and glucose tolerance. These confirm other studies suggesting that insulin sensitivity is improved when omega-3 intake is increased. Follow the Savanna Model and make sure you have the omega-6 to omega-3 intakes in balance.</i>
