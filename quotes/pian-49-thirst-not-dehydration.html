<i>It is often claimed that by the time people feel thirsty, they are already dehydrated. On the contrary, thirst begins when the blood has become less dilute by under 2 percent, whereas dehydration begins when the blood has become less dilute by at least 5 percent. When we were kids and were thirsty, we just ran up to a tap and gulped from it. Now the authorities are backing this principle. Let thirst be your guideâ€” you do not have to drink water if you are not thirsty.</i>
