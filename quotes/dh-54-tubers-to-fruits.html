<i>Above ground, the edible part can be the stem, bud, leafstalk, leaf, bean pod, or the immature flower. In addition, there are some fruits, such as the avocado and tomato, which are included in the vegetable category. Indeed, most people think of them and use them as vegetables, so they are surprised to hear that, botanically, avocado and tomato are fruits. A large percentage of our ancestors' food supply came from vegetation that was levered out of the ground with a digging stick. Today, we still eat many foods that grow undergroundâ€” roots, tubers, bulbs, and corms (solid bulbs).</i>
