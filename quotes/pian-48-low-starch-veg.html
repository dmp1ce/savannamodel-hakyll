Low-starch vegetables should be served five times daily. <i>These are the usual items we call vegetables, such as green beans, broccoli, and kaleâ€” with the exception of potato, of course. We should also go easy on sweet potato, carrots, and peas, which are starchy-sugary and moderately glycemic.</i>
