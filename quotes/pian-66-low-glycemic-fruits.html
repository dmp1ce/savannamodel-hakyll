<i>Fruits that are both low-glycemic and low-sugar are "good" to eat without restriction ( . . . ). Fruits in this category include gooseberry and raspberry. There are other low-glycemic fruits, such as cherries, which nevertheless have a significant content of various sugars. There is not a direct correlation between sugar content and glycemic index ( . . . ). You should go easy on these fruits if your doctor is asking you to restrict your intake of fructose or glucose.</i>
