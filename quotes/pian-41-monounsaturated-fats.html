<i>Monounsaturated fats were quite common in our ancestral environment, particularly in the marrow of bones and many nuts. Our bodies know how to handle them in a healthy way. Health benefits of monounsaturated fats include lowering cholesterol levels, reducing the risk of heart disease and stroke, and enhancing cell building and the immune system. Today, our most common source is olive oil. Avocado is another good source.</i>
