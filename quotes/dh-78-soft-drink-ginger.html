<i>Jacob Schweppe, a jeweler in Geneva, read Priestley's papers and, by 1794, was selling highly carbonated waters to his friends. He added other mineral salts and flavors, such as ginger, lemon, and quinine (to make tonic water). Schweppe moved to London and built a worldwide soft drinks empire.</i>
