<i>Frozen, chopped vegetables are a good standby. They can be stir-fried, just as they come, in their own juices. No need to use a wokâ€”just heat rapidly and stir constantly for five to six minutes in a large saucepan. Always use plenty of herbs. The basic stir-fry herb mixture contains oregano, crushed bay leaves, basil, and thyme. You can make up your own mix using equal parts of these herbs, or find a product that conforms closely to this recipe.</i>
