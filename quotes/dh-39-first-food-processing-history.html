<i>With the Industrial Revolution going full-swing during the 19th century, cities grew to sizes never before seen in history. Chicago's population increased 17-fold from 30,000 in 1850 to 500,000 in 1870. New York City grew 25 times bigger, from 60,000 in 1800 to 1.5 million in 1870. In contrast, Babylon at the time of the Biblical exodus (1447 B .C .) was only about 60,000 total. Feeding populations in these enormous agglomerations required novel methods. It was quite impossible to get most fresh foods to them in the normal way. Food had to be "preserved,"— that is, processed in a way that stopped it from going bad. Meat and fish were a particular problem but there were tried-and-true methods to con­ serve it: salting and smoking. Salt beef, bacon, cured ham, kippered herring, and bologna were just a few examples that took over the diet of city dwellers, replacing their fresh equivalent.</i>
