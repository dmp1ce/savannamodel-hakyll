<i>Acids are compounds that taste sour and eat away at metals. Examples are the citric acid in lemons, acetic acid in vinegar, and sulfuric acid in car batteries. Alkalis (also known as "bases") are the opposite; in a way, they are the antidote to acids. For example, the stomach contains hydrochloric acid, which sometimes causes indigestion; the antidote is an alkali (or "antacid"), such as sodium bicarbonate and magnesium hydroxide. When acid and alkali cancel each other out, the result is neutralityâ€” the blood is neither acid nor alkaline.</i>
