<i>All tree nuts are generally fine. Examples are walnuts, almonds, Brazil nuts, and filberts. However, chestnuts, coconut, and peanuts do not fit into this tree nut category. Chestnuts are mainly starch and so are included in the starchy vegetable group; coconuts are mainly oil and are included in the fats and oils group. Peanuts are not nuts; they are a legume and are included in the previous legume group.</i>
