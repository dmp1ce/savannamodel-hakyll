<i>With regard to athletes, Dr. Deborah Cohen (investigations editor of the British Medical Journal) observed that no marathon runner has suffered from dehydration, whereas some sixteen marathon runners have died from over-hydration (water intoxication) and 1,600 were made critically ill. She found that sports drink companies sponsor scientists dedicated to promoting hydration. Their greatest success was to undermine the idea that the body has a perfectly good mechanism for detecting dehydrationâ€” thirst. And so they have spread false alarms about the "dangers" of dehydration.</i>
