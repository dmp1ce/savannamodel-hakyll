<i>In times of plenty, the Eskimo could consume prodigious amounts of meat: 9 lbs in a day has been measured as a normal occurrence. At such times they drank prodigious amounts of water, tooâ€” which is a direct result of eating an excess of protein (see "Alkalizing" section in Chapter 1 and "Acid-alkali Balance" section in the Ow ner's Manual). The kidneys needed to flush out the overabundant amino acids (proteins).</i>
