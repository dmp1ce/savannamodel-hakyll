<i>The manufacturer, Quorn, makes it available either in its raw state as a kind of ground meat look-alike or made up into veggie burgers, frankfurters, and soon. Mycoprotein is by far the best meat substitute when compared to soy protein or wheat gluten protein (seitan). Mycoprotein has a medium protein content, on a par with eggs (about 12 g protein per 100 g).</i>
