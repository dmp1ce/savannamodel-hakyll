<i>What are alkali-forming foods? They are ones that have a predominance of the metallic elements potassium, sodium, iron, and calciumâ€” chiefly fruit, salads, and non-starchy vegetables. This demands an explanation, because many of these foods, notably fruit, taste acid but are, nevertheless, alkalizing in effect. For example, grapefruit, although acid to the taste, is strongly alkalizing.</i>
