<i>We only need about one gram each of omega-6 and omega-3 oils. We need to strip out the omega-6 oils to the point where we are only consuming a couple of grams a day at most, and we need to make sure we get at least one gram a day of omega-3 oils. Eating oily fish every day will help you boost your intake of omega-3.</i>
