<i>We have seen how most sugars— e.g., the high-glycemic ones such as table sugar— and most confectionary are harmful for us. They must be ruthlessly removed from the diet. More surprising for many of you is that the "natural" sugars, honey and maple syrup, are to be treated with caution. Some dried fruits have high sugar content and are highly glycemic; for example, dried figs, dried dates, sultanas, and dried apricots. They should be avoided.</i>
