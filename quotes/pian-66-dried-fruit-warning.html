<i>You should treat dried fruit (raisins, currants, dates, figs, apricots, peaches, etc.) as sugars. The drying process destroys some of the micronutrients, so in no way can dried fruit be a substitute for the fresh variety. In addition, we do not recommend that you liquidize fruits. Juicing, pasteurizing, concentrating, and reconstituting are processes that destroy the nature and utility of the natural fibers, strip out the nutrients, and increase the glycemic index.</i>
